# testing-automation
first commit
Very early, rough first commit of my work at the QA Testing Automation course I took at Egg Cooperation. Some stuff is still in Spanish, so I gotta fix that, make the whole repo more homogeneous. 
In terms of content, there's a lot of stuff. Mostly Selenium Java exercises, but also some Cypress (which I adored) and some restassured stuff. In the short-term, I hope to add comments both in english and spanish to most of the exercises, and (hopefully) implement a bit of Page Object Model on my earliest selenium works. I have to brush up on my Object Oriented Programming theory first though.
